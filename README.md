# LabVIEW MIDI Project

A comprehensive MIDI interface implementation for LabVIEW, transforming your G-code into G-major.

## Requirements

- LabVIEW 2020 64-bit
- VIPM (JKI VI Package Manager)
- MIDI-compatible audio interface or software synthesizer

## Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**: Apply the `MIDI Driver.vipc` package to install all required dependencies
2. **Run Example**: Execute `main.vi` to launch the demonstration application

## Getting Started

After installation, run `main.vi` to see the core functionality in action. The example demonstrates basic MIDI communication patterns and provides a foundation for custom implementations.
